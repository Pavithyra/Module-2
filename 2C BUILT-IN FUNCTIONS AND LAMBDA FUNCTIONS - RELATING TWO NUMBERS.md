## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS - decimal number to octal number using built-in function

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to check the relation between two numbers — whether one number is greater than, equal to, or lesser than another — using a lambda function.

---

### ALGORITHM

1.Begin the program. 
2.Read the integer input from the user and store them in str. 
3.perform built-in function oct() on str and them in x. 
4.Display the X. 
5.Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```

Nmae:Pavithra.S

str = int(input())
x=oct(str)
print(x)
```
